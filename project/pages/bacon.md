title: Pygame 
date: 2017-08-02 11:25:00 PM

I am currently building a simple game in pygame. I am running into some issues with collisions. I find myself using other people's code too often, and not building it myself. It's a little difficult for me, at the moment, to construct my own thing. I notice that I have a tendency to do that. I don't stick with a hard problem. I try to weasel my self out of it.
