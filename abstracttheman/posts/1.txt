This is the title
You see. Anything I write. There is a ton of doubt because it is going public. And there is my name associated with it. There is going to be judgement. By whom? Primarily from myself masquerading as other people. It has been stuffed down that it doesn't matter what others think. The others might as well be a hallucination at that point. Than what is the resistance? What is the fear? It's also useless meandering. No one will see. No one will care. Just move on. Put it out. This is a test. This isn't anything worth mentioning.
